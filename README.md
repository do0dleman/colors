# Color schemes generating web app on react

This project was made to generate different color schemes from one "seed" color. 

## Github pages 

You can see and use the app on github pages [here](https://do0dleman.github.io/colors/).

## Generation methods

The project basically uses 4 different color schemes generation methods:
- **Monochromatic colors**
- **Analog colors**
- **Triadic colors**
- **Tetraidic colors** 

In first method only lightness is being changed. 
In three others methods hue is being changed.
Then colors' value is being changed to make different shades.
